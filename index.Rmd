This is the attempt to redo all exercises of the seminar about machine learning of Andreas Brandmaier named "Trends in der Psychologischen Methodenlehre" in `tidymodels`. The result is supposed to be a set of scripts/markdowns that give a nice overview of all used models and techniques with a unified interface.

You can find all source code + data neccesary to build this site on [github](https://github.com/aaronpeikert/hu_ml).
