title: "Model Selection"
description: |
  Personally I think model selection is the single most important topic in ML. Sadly we had only one session about it, however I might extend this topic beyond the seminars scope, becouse this is where `tidymodels` really shines.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
if(!require("pacman"))install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load("here", "fs", "tidyverse", "tidymodels", "pander")
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```
